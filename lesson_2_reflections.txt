		once a logical change is done, add it to the staging area, then 
		use the git commit command to add the commit to the repo and log

	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
		branches help when a developer wants to experiment with the code
		base, but doesnt want to alter the original project. So there
		will always be a working original app. a few example reasons are:
		adding a language, adding a complicated feature, etc.
